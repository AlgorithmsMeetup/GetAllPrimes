# Sieve Of Eratosthenes #

## The challenge  ##
Give a number, max
find all the primes that are smaller or equal to max.

## One way to do it: Sieve Of Eratosthenes: ##
Once you have found a prime number, you can pretty much eliminate
a lot of not primes later by multiplying that prime with a series of numbers.

Ex: starting from number 2, you can 2X2=4 which eliminates 4, 2X3=6 which eliminates 6,
2X4 which eliminates 8, etc...
